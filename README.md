# NewsScrape

NewsScrape is an app that utilizes scraping technology to pull articles from a news website and display them onto the app. For this case, the app will scrape through The New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/). Once this is done, users are able to view, save, leave comments on the latest news, and delete them.
